title: Create a Multiuser GraphQL CRUD(L) App in 10 minutes with the new AWS Amplify CLI (and, in a few extra minutes, add search capabilities with Elasticsearch)
description: 'In this tutorial, we will check how we can create a secure multiuser Note Taking App with full CRUD capabilities backed by a Serverless GraphQL API (powered by AWS AppSync) and by a Serverless NoSQL Database (powered by Amazon DynamoDB) in less than 10 minutes with full user isolation as each user can only access and edit their own content. Best of all, we only need 150 lines of code!'
